## Advanced CSS & Sass - Tracking progress

This repo contains all the same files from Jonas Schmedtmann's course "Advanced CSS & Sass" and have all been built and designed by him. I'm working through the starter files and implement the code as instructed and use git to track my own progress of going through the course.

This repository only contains my code of the Natours project, as I haven't worked on the CSS and Flexbox course of this course (Nexter and Trillio), as I previously alreadly completed a number of different projects and courses that taught these two technologies. 

Technologies & Concepts used in this course:

- HTML
- Advanced CSS and Sass (SCSS) techniques
- Animations
- Responsiveness and Media Queries
- Desktop-first approach (rather than mobile first)
